## 🧪 Lab 1: Mini Project - HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript Basics

📅 Class Description
During the first class, we created a simple responsive website.

HTML5:

Document structure
Semantic elements
Forms and validation
CSS:

Styling elements
Layouts (flexbox, grid)
Animations and transitions
JavaScript:

Basic syntax
DOM manipulation
Event handling

## 🧪 Lab 3: Advanced JavaScript, Fetch API

📅 Class Description
In the third class, we expanded our JavaScript skills and learned how to use the Fetch API. Additionally, we created a simple shooting game.

## 🧪 Lab 4: Microservices, Flask, SpringBoot, Express.js

📅 Class Description
The fourth laboratory was dedicated to microservices - small, independent services that work together to create a complete application. ⚙️ 🔗

During these classes, we focused on three popular frameworks for creating microservices: Flask, SpringBoot, and Express.js. 🐍 ☕ ⏩

Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. 🐍 🧪
SpringBoot is a framework for creating web applications and microservices in Java. ☕ 🌱
Express.js is a fast, reliable, and minimalist framework for creating web applications and APIs in Node.js. ⏩ 💻

During the classes, we learned the basics of these frameworks, how to create simple microservices, and how to connect them together. 🤝 🚀

Additionally, we learned the basics of the HTTP protocol, which is crucial for communication between microservices. 🌐 🛰️

## 🧪 Lab 5: React

📅 Class Description
The fifth laboratory was dedicated to one of the most popular frameworks for building user interfaces - React. ⚛️

During these classes, we learned the basics of React, including how to create components, manage state, and pass data between components. 🏗️ 🎛️

Additionally, we understood how React utilizes the virtual DOM for performance optimization and how to use Hooks for state management and side effects. ♻️ ⏩

These classes allowed us to understand how to create interactive and responsive user interfaces using React. 💻 🚀

🤗 Summary
These laboratories allowed us to gain a solid understanding of web application development, including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, and microservices. We acquired practical skills in building web applications and learned how to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
